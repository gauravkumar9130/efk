To create:
kubectl create ns efk
kubectl rollout restart deployment coredns -n kube-system (Sometimes error comes related to DNS to avoid error we use this command)
kubectl create -f .

To verify:
kubectl get pods -n efk

To access:
kubectl get svc -n efk (Check and Open Cluster IP of Kibana service with port nubmer 5601)

Once it's opened then click on explore on my own -> left side click on discover -> Create on create data view to Kibana -> 
    Name: efk-k8s
    Index Pattern: node-*
    Save

For testing:
kubectl create deployment hello --image=quay.io/gauravkumar9130/nginx --replicas=2

Now go to Kibana console -> left side click on discover -> left side under fields click on Message -> then we will see that there is a container created with named hello

kubectl delete deployment hello

Now on Kibana console refresh and we will be able to see new log will show deleted containers
